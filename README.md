# Analyze A/B Test Results
Udacity Data Analyst Degree

## Overview
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. The data is provided by Udacity.
